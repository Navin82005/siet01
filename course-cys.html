                <h3>About The Department</h3>
                <p>
                    The Department of Information Technology was established in 2006 with the objective of imparting quality education in the field of Information Technology.

The faculty members update their knowledge by regularly attending various conferences and faculty development program .Several faculty members are currently doing their research work and are involved in taking care of software projects. <br><br><br>
                    Mere theoretical knowledge is not sufficient for the students hence Industrial visit is considered as one of the most practical methods of teaching. Students are taken for a guided tour to various industries, providing them information about the background of the companies and their current position in the global business scenario. It helps the students to know things practically through interaction, working methods and employment practices. Moreover, it gives exposure from academic point of view. <br><br><br>
                    With a view to bridge the gap between industrial requirements and academic curriculum, the department invites experts from various fields of engineering and management to enable the students to know and understand the requirements of industries. And have designed a discussion forum to share and learn. <br><br><br>
                    A team of learned and dedicated teachers train the students in the latest technology enabling them to acquire the necessary skills to work in any reputed IT industry and prides itself on good career opportunities for students. There is a major contribution from our Alumni team in the development of the department as well as mentoring and sharing experiences to the existing students. <br>
